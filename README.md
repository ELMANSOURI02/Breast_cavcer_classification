# Breast_cavcer_classification

Project Overview

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to classify breast cancer as either malignant or benign. By using supervised learning algorithms on a breast cancer dataset, this project aims to assist in early diagnosis and improve treatment decisions.

Breast cancer classification is a crucial application of machine learning in healthcare. Early and accurate classification can significantly improve patient outcomes by enabling timely interventions.
